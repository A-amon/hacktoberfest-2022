# 👇 How to contribute to open source projects? 👇
- You need to fork the repository first
- Then you need to clone the repository to your machine
- After that, you need to create a new branch [ you can name it the same as your username ]
- Then start writing your code inside of your branch (not inside of 'main')
- When you're happy with it, you need to send a commit and leave a commit message for clarity
- Lastly, you need to create a Pull Request, tag yourself as an 'assignee' and wait for it to be merged if it passes Team's review
